## üìä Problem: Exploring the Central Limit Theorem Through Simulations

### üìö Motivation

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases‚Äîregardless of the original population distribution. This forms a foundational concept in statistics, crucial for estimation, hypothesis testing, and real-world modeling.

## üîç Tasks

### 1. **Simulating Sampling Distributions**

* Choose population distributions:

  * Uniform
  * Exponential
  * Binomial
* Draw a large population dataset from each.

### 2. **Sampling and Visualization**

* Randomly sample with sizes $n = 5, 10, 30, 50$
* Repeat sampling (e.g., 10,000 times) to build a distribution of the sample means
* Plot histograms and observe convergence to a normal shape

### 3. **Parameter Exploration**

* Observe how:

  * Sample size affects convergence
  * Population distribution shape affects spread
  * Population variance influences sampling distribution width

### 4. **Applications**

* Population parameter estimation
* Quality control
* Financial modeling predictions

## üíª Tools & Suggestions

* **Python Libraries**:

  * `NumPy` for sampling
  * `Matplotlib` or `Seaborn` for visualization
* **Begin with**: Uniform or normal distributions
* **Explore later**: Skewed/exponential or discrete/binomial

## üì§ Deliverables

1. Jupyter Notebook or Markdown report with simulations
2. Histograms and overlayed normal curves
3. Reflections on results and theoretical expectations
