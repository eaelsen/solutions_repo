## ‚öõÔ∏è Problem: Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

### üß≤ Motivation

The Lorentz force:

$$
\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

governs charged particle motion in electric and magnetic fields. Simulating this helps visualize behavior in devices like cyclotrons, mass spectrometers, and magnetic traps.

## üî¨ Project Tasks

### 1. **Exploration of Applications**

* Particle accelerators, fusion devices, astrophysics
* Understand the roles of electric ($\vec{E}$) and magnetic ($\vec{B}$) fields

### 2. **Simulating Particle Motion**

* Scenarios:

  * Uniform magnetic field
  * Uniform electric field
  * Crossed $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ fields
* Solve Newton's second law using:

  * Euler or Runge-Kutta methods

### 3. **Parameter Exploration**

* Vary:

  * Field strengths
  * Initial velocity
  * Charge-to-mass ratio ($q/m$)
* Observe effects on path shape, radius, and drift

### 4. **Visualization**

* 2D/3D trajectory plots
* Identify:

  * Circular motion (Larmor radius)
  * Helical paths
  * E√óB drift
