## âš¡ Problem: Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

### ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Graph theory provides a powerful way to model and solve complex resistor networks, especially when traditional series-parallel methods fall short. By modeling resistors as weighted edges and nodes as junctions, circuits can be simplified iteratively.

## ðŸ§  Task Options

### **Option 1 â€“ Simplified Task (Algorithm Description)**

* Describe an algorithm that:

  * Identifies and reduces series and parallel connections
  * Iteratively simplifies the graph
* Emphasize how nested combinations are resolved

### **Option 2 â€“ Advanced Task (Algorithm Implementation)**

* Implement in Python (suggested using `networkx`)

* Must handle:

  * Input graphs
  * Nested and mixed series-parallel configurations
  * Output of final equivalent resistance

* **Test Cases**:

  * Simple series/parallel resistors
  * Nested circuits
  * Graphs with multiple loops or cycles

## ðŸ’» Suggested Python Libraries

* `networkx`: Graph modeling
* `sympy`: Symbolic simplification (optional)
* `matplotlib`: For visualizing the circuit

## ðŸ“¤ Deliverables

* Pseudocode or full Python implementation
* Description of how complex networks are handled
* Analysis of performance, strengths, and limitations
