## 🌍 Project: Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

### 🎯 Motivation

Gravitational acceleration $g$ is fundamental in physics. Using a simple pendulum, we can estimate $g$ experimentally and analyze measurement uncertainties to understand data accuracy and limitations.

## 🛠 Materials

* String (\~1 or 1.5 m)
* Small weight (e.g., keychain, coins)
* Ruler or measuring tape
* Stopwatch or timer (phone works too)

---

## 🔬 Experimental Steps

1. **Measure Pendulum Length** $L$ from pivot to center of mass.
2. **Measure 10 full oscillations** (repeat 10 times for averaging).
3. Calculate:

   * Mean time $\overline{T_{10}}$
   * Uncertainty $\Delta T_{10} = \frac{\sigma_T}{\sqrt{n}}$
4. Determine:

   * Period $T = \frac{\overline{T_{10}}}{10}$
   * Gravitational acceleration: $g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$

## 🧮 Uncertainty Propagation

$$
\Delta g = g \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta L}{L}\right)^2 + \left(2 \frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)^2}
$$

## 📊 Analysis

* Compare your result to $g = 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2$
* Discuss:

  * Effects of measurement tool resolution
  * Manual timing errors
  * Possible experimental assumptions or biases

## ✅ Deliverables

* Markdown table with:

  * $L, \Delta L, T_{10}, \sigma_T, \overline{T_{10}}, \Delta T$
* Calculated values of $g$ and $\Delta g$
* Written analysis of error sources and conclusions
