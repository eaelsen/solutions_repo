It defines the minimum speed an object must reach to break free from a celestial body\u2019s gravitational field without further propulsion . Beyond basic escape velocity, we define three \u201ccosmic velocities\u201d that describe thresholds for: Stable orbiting Escaping the planet Escaping the gravitational pull of an entire star system These velocities govern nearly all aspects of spaceflight mechanics , from launching satellites and space stations to sending probes across the solar system and beyond. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing missions, determining energy requirements, and planning interplanetary or interstellar journeys. \ud83d\udcd8 Theoretical Foundation and Derivations \ud83d\udd39 1. First Cosmic Velocity \u2013 Orbital Velocity This is the minimum horizontal speed needed for an object to enter a stable circular orbit just above the surface of a planet, without falling back due to gravity. Derived from centripetal force balancing gravitational attraction: \\[ \\frac{mv^2}{r} = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\] Solving for \\(v\\) : \\[ \\boxed{v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}} \\] Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2\\) ) \\(M\\) : Mass of the planet \\(r\\) : Radius from the center of the planet to the object \ud83d\udd39 2. Second Cosmic Velocity \u2013 Escape Velocity This is the minimum speed required to escape the planet\u2019s gravitational influence completely (i.e., reach infinity with zero speed). Derived from conservation of energy: \\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{r} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\boxed{v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}} \\] \u27a1\ufe0f Note that \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot v_1\\) This relationship holds under the assumption of: No air resistance Launch from the surface Spherically symmetric mass distribution \ud83d\udd39 3. Third Cosmic Velocity \u2013 Interstellar Escape Velocity This is the minimum speed needed to escape not only Earth\u2019s gravity, but also the Sun\u2019s gravitational pull \u2014i.e., to leave the entire solar system. This is more complex, as it involves multiple gravitational potentials (Earth + Sun). Assuming you start from Earth\u2019s surface and ignore all resistive forces: \\[ v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{v_{\\text{esc, Earth}}^2 + v_{\\text{orb, Earth around Sun}}^2} \\] Since: Earth's escape velocity \\(v_2 \\approx 11.2 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) Earth's orbital speed around the Sun \\(v_{\\text{orb}} \\approx 29.8 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) Then: \\[ \\boxed{v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{11.2^2 + 29.8^2} \\approx 42.1 \\, \\text{km/s}} \\] This is an approximation .
